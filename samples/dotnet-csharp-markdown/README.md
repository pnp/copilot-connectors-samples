# Ingest local markdown content using C# and .NET

## Summary

This samples contains a Microsoft Graph connector that shows how to ingest local markdown files. For each file, it extracts the metadata from front matter, maps them to the external connection's schema and ingests the content retaining the content and metadata. The ingested content is set to be visible to everyone in the organization.

Version|Date|Comments
-------|----|--------
1.1|October 09, 2023|Added configuring result layout
1.0|September 29, 2023|Initial release

## Prerequisites

- [Microsoft 365 Developer tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [.NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
- [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation?view=graph-powershell-1.0)
- Microsoft PowerShell

## Minimal path to awesome

- Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/graph-connectors-samples/tree/main/samples/dotnet-csharp-markdown) then unzip it)
- Run the setup script: `./setup.ps1`. When finished, it will store information about the Entra ID app in user secrets
- Build the project: `dotnet build`
- Change the working directory: `cd bin/Debug/net7.0`
- Create the external connection: `./connector create-connection` (this will take several minutes)
- Ingest the content: `./connector load-content`
- [Create result type](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/manage-result-types) with default settings and the external connection you've just created
- Use the `resultLayout.json` file for the Adaptive Card code

## Features

This sample shows how to ingest local markdown content with its front matter metadata to Microsoft 365. The sample contains a content folder with several blog posts by [Waldek Mastykarz](https://blog.mastykarz.nl/). These files are parsed and ingested by the sample Microsoft Graph connector.

The sample illustrates the following concepts:

- script creating the Entra ID (Azure AD) application using the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK
- create external connection including URL to item resolver to track activity when users share external links
- create external connection schema
- parse local markdown files to get their content and front matter metadata
- ingest content with initial activities
- visualize the external content in search results using a custom Adaptive Card
- extend Microsoft Graph .NET SDK with a middleware to wait for a long-running operation to complete
- extend Microsoft Graph .NET SDK with a debug middleware to show information about outgoing requests and incoming responses
- use Microsoft 365 Developer Proxy mocks to simulate creation of the external connection and its schema
