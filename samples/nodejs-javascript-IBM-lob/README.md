- [Node@18](https://nodejs.org)
- Bash

## Minimal path to awesome

- Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/graph-connectors-samples/tree/main/samples/nodejs-javascript-solutiongallery) then unzip it)
- Make the setup script executable, by running `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
- Run the setup script: `./setup.sh`. When finished, it will create a local `env.js` file with information about the AAD app, required to run the code
- Restore dependencies: `npm install`
- Create the external connection: `npm run createConnection` (this will take several minutes)
- Ingest the content: `npm run loadContent`

## Features

This sample shows how to use query LOB Data from IBM DB2 located on IBM Cloud (external) into your Microsoft 365 tenant.

The sample illustrates the following concepts:

- script creating the Entra ID (Azure AD) application using CLI for Microsoft 365
- create external connection schema
- retrieve data from a remote API and add to the index
- logging errors for easy debugging
- visualize the external content in search results using a custom Adaptive Card
- extend Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK with a [middleware to wait for a long-running operation to complete](https://blog.mastykarz.nl/easily-handle-long-running-operations-middleware-microsoft-graph-javascript-sdk/)
- extend Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK with a [debug middleware](https://blog.mastykarz.nl/easily-debug-microsoft-graph-javascript-sdk-requests/) to show information about outgoing requests and incoming responses
