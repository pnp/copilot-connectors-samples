# Ingest local markdown content using JavaScript and Node.js

## Summary

This samples contains a Microsoft Graph connector that shows how to ingest local markdown files. For each file, it extracts the metadata from front matter, maps them to the external connection's schema and ingests the content retaining the content and metadata. The ingested content is set to be visible to everyone in the organization.

## Prerequisites

- [Microsoft 365 Developer tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Node@18](https://nodejs.org)
- Bash

## Minimal path to awesome

- Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/graph-connectors-samples/tree/main/samples/nodejs-javascript-markdown) then unzip it)
- Make the setup script executable, by running `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
- Run the setup script: `./setup.sh`. When finished, it will create a local `env.js` file with information about the AAD app, required to run the code
- Restore dependencies: `npm install`
- Create the external connection: `npm run createConnection` (this will take several minutes)
- Ingest the content: `npm run loadContent`

## Features

This sample shows how to ingest local markdown content with its front matter metadata to Microsoft 365. The sample contains a content folder with several blog posts by [Waldek Mastykarz](https://blog.mastykarz.nl/). These files are parsed and ingested by the sample Microsoft Graph connector.

The sample illustrates the following concepts:

- script creating the Entra (Azure AD) app registration using CLI for Microsoft 365
- create external connection including URL to item resolver to track activity when users share external links
- create external connection schema
- parse local markdown files to get their content and front matter metadata
- ingesting content with initial activities
- visualize the external content in search results using a custom Adaptive Card
- extend Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK with a middleware to wait for a long-running operation to complete
- extend Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK with a [debug middleware](https://blog.mastykarz.nl/easily-debug-microsoft-graph-javascript-sdk-requests/) to show information about outgoing requests and incoming responses
- use Microsoft 365 Developer Proxy mocks to simulate creation of the external connection and its schema

If you want to use Microsoft 365 Developer Proxy to simulate API responses:

- `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` is required to skip certificate validation errors when using the Microsoft 365 Developer Proxy
- `NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1` suppresses Node.js warnings about skipping certificate validation

These environment variables are included in the `:proxy`-suffixed scripts in `package.json`.
