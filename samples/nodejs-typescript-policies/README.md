# Policies Graph connector

## Summary

This sample project uses Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code to simplify the process of creating a [Microsoft Graph connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/connecting-external-content-connectors-overview) that ingests data from a custom API to Microsoft Graph. It provides an end to end example of creating the connector, ingesting content and refreshing the ingested content.

## Features

This sample shows how to ingest data from a custom API into your Microsoft 365 tenant.

The sample illustrates the following concepts:

- simplify debugging and provisioning of resources with Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio code
- create external connection schema
- support full ingestion of data
- visualize the external content in Microsoft 365 search results

## Prerequisites

- [Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension)
- [Azure Functions Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
- [Microsoft 365 Developer tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) with [uploading custom apps enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/m365-apps/prerequisites#prepare-a-developer-tenant-for-testing)
- [Node@18](https://nodejs.org)

## Minimal path to awesome - Debug against a real Microsoft 365 tenant

- Clone repo
- Open repo in VSCode
- Press <kbd>F5</kbd>, follow the sign in prompts
- When prompted, click on the link in the console to perform the tenant-wide admin consent
- Wait for all tasks to complete
- In the web browser navigate to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/)
- From the side navigation, open [Settings > Search & Intelligence](https://admin.microsoft.com/?source=applauncher#/MicrosoftSearch)
- On the page, navigate to the [Data Sources](https://admin.microsoft.com/?source=applauncher#/MicrosoftSearch/connectors) tab
- A table will display available connections. Locate the **Policy Management** connection. In the **Required actions** column, select the link to **Include Connector Results** and confirm the prompt
- Navigate to [Microsoft365.com](https://www.microsoft365.com)
- Using the search box on top, search for: `acceptable use policy`. You should see the following result:

> [!NOTE]  
> It can take a moment for the search results to appear. If you don't see the results immediately, wait a few moments and try again.

## Using another scenario

The sample provides 3 scenarios to ingest data into Microsoft 365: `IT Policies`, `Financial Services` and `Healthcare`. To switch between scenarios, update the `CONNECTOR_SCENARIO` environment variable in the `.env.*` file to one of the following:

- `IT Policies`: `CONNECTOR_SCENARIO=it-policies`
- `Financial Services`: `CONNECTOR_SCENARIO=financial-services`
- `Healthcare`: `CONNECTOR_SCENARIO=healthcare`

## Providing your own scenario

This sample is extensible and you can provide your own scenario. To do so, you need to:

1. Create a new folder in the `content` folder
2. Add your `md` files with the content you want to ingest
3. Update the `CONNECTOR_SCENARIO` environment variable in the `.env.*` file to the name of the folder you created
