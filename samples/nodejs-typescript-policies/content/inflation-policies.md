## Common Themes Across Countries

1. **Transparency**: All central banks emphasize clear communication of policy decisions and rationale.

2. **Independence**: Central bank independence from political influence is a key principle.

3. **Forward Guidance**: Increasing use of communication about future policy intentions to influence expectations.

4. **Flexibility**: All frameworks allow for some flexibility to address short-term economic shocks.

5. **Global Coordination**: Increasing awareness of international spillovers and need for policy coordination, especially during crises.

6. **Comprehensive Approach**: Recognition that inflation control requires a mix of monetary, fiscal, and structural policies.

7. **Review Process**: Periodic reviews of monetary policy frameworks to ensure effectiveness in changing economic environments.
