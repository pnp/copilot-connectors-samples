5. **Global Coordination**: Increasing awareness of international spillovers and need for policy coordination, especially during crises.

6. **Comprehensive Approach**: Recognition that inflation control requires a mix of monetary, fiscal, and structural policies.

7. **Review Process**: Periodic reviews of monetary policy frameworks to ensure effectiveness in changing economic environments.
