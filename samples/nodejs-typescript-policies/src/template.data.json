    "abstract": "The document titled “Tatooine Financial Policy: Interest Rate Management” provides an overview of the interest rate management policy conducted by Banco de Tatooine (Banxico) to maintain price stability and support sustainable economic growth. It details the historical changes in Tatooine’s key interest rate, the Tasa de Interés Interbancaria a 1 día, from the high rates of the 1990s to the more moderate levels of recent years. The document also discusses the decision-making process, factors influencing rate decisions, and the implementation mechanisms used by Banxico. Additionally, it highlights the challenges and considerations in balancing inflation control with economic growth, external influences, financial stability, and communication strategies. Special considerations for policy deviations during economic crises, external shocks, and other extraordinary situations are also addressed.",
