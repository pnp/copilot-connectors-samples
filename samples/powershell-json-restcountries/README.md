# Ingest REST Countries content using PowerShell

## Summary

This sample contains a Microsoft Graph connector built in PowerShell that shows how to ingest [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/) content. For each country, it extracts the metadata from the [REST API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all), maps them to the external connection's schema and ingests the content retaining the content and metadata. The ingested content is set to be visible to everyone in the organization.

## Minimal path to awesome

- Clone this repository (or [download this solution as a .ZIP file](https://pnp.github.io/download-partial/?url=https://github.com/pnp/graph-connectors-samples/tree/main/samples/powershell-json-restcountries) then unzip it)
- Follow the script:

    ```powershell
    # Ensure you've got a default secret store configured, by running
    Get-SecretVault

    # If nothing shows up, run
    Register-SecretVault -Name LocalStore -ModuleName Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore -DefaultVault

    # Create Entra app
    .\Initialize-EntraApp.ps1

    # Create external connection
    .\Initialize-ExternalConnection.ps1

    # Import content
    .\Import-Content.ps1
    ```

- [Create result type](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/manage-result-types) with default settings and the external connection you've just created
- Use the `resultLayout.json` file for the Adaptive Card code

## Features

This sample shows how to ingest REST Countries content with its metadata to Microsoft 365. The sample downloads the countries information in to a content folder with a file per country. These files are parsed and ingested by the sample Microsoft Graph connector.

The sample illustrates the following concepts:

- script creating the Entra (Azure AD) app registration using the Microsoft Graph CLI
- create external connection including URL to item resolver to track activity when users share external links
- create external connection schema
- parse json from REST API to get the content
- ingest content with initial activities
- visualize the external content in search results using a custom Adaptive Card
